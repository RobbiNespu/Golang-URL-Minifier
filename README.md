# Golang URL Minifier

[Check it out at http://r8r.org](http://r8r.org)

A URL minifier written in Go.

  - Enter long URL
  - Receive small URL
  - Magic?

You can also:
  - Use the API to integrate your apps

### Tech

Golang URL Minifier relies on open source projects to work properly:

* [pq] - A pure Go postgres driver for Go's database/sql package
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - For quick UI creation
* [jQuery] - Because Stackoverflow said I had to?

And of course Golang URL Minifier itself is open source with a [public repository][gomin]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Golang URL Minifier requires [pq](https://github.com/lib/pq) to run.

```sh
$ go get github.com/lib/pq
```

### Todos

 - Admin dashboard
 - User accounts to remove throttle
 - Traffic analytics
 - ???
 - Profit!
